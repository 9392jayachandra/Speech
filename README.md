Speech Emotion Recognition project aims to develop a system capable of automatically detecting emotions from speech signals. We start by collecting a dataset of speech samples labeled with 
corresponding emotions. Preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and standardize the audio data. Feature extraction methods such as MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) are 
used to capture relevant information from the speech signals. Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural 
Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neurals Networks (CNNs), are trained on the extracted features to classify emotions. The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score 
to assess its performance. We then fine-tune the model and optimize hyperparameters to improve its accuracy. Finally, we deploy the trained model into a real-world application where 
it can accurately recognize emotions in speech in real-time.
